## Mission & Vision ðŸ›©
What does Effect Network want to achieve?

## Glossary
crypto, blockchain, EOS / BSC, IPFS, , Force, templates, campaigns, tasks, batches, workers, requester, 

Before we get started there are some terms that need to be discussed in order to get a proper idea of what is happening.
First let's get started with the users of the platform: workers and requesters

### Workers
Workers are the engine of the Effect Network. They are the human intelligence in the backend that they do the tasks. The tasks are presented to them in templates. Ideally, the tasks are designed in such a way that they can be done within minutes.

### Requesters
Requesters submit tasks to the platform via templates for workers to work on. 



## Quickstart SDK
Introduction, Quick start, init client, create campaign, create task, publish task, response


## EOS GUIDE
Getting started with EOS.
Developers need to be familiar with using EOS, because our technology is built using EOS. They need to know how to do the following:
- An introduction on using EOS wallets
- Open an account: see https://effect-dao-docs.gitbook.io/dao-guides/eos-guides/creating-an-eos-account
    - How to create an account using blocks.io
    - How to create an account using tokenpocket
- Do transactions
- Calling smart contract methods? This might be unnecessary
- Loading their accounts with resources in order to do transactions on the EOS network



## BSC GUIDE
Why BSC, and how to get started. 
## Example: Legendary Parakeet

TODO clean up the legendary parakeet app and implement the SDK in to it. 
Use it as an example to show how the flow of the application would work.
How it will show up in the worker interface. 

This chapter will have a narrative structure to give a concrete example of what is possible.
