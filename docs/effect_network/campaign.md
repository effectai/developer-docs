# Campaign

The Effect Network campaign is the main orginisational unit within which certain types of tasks are done. 
Multiple campaigns can be owned by one user. Campaigns can contain only one [template](template.md). 
As discussed in the template section, templates are used to present tasks to the workers.
They are predefined by the requester and then presented to the user filled in with data and input elements for users to interact with the template.
