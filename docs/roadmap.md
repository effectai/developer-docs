## Projects

#### Updates to DAO

This year Effect DAO will gain more technical responsibilities for maintaining
the network. We are working on a new proposal and reward system for the DAO that
will allow proposals to influence and change important network settings. The DAO
will be able to do more important tasks than managing the treausury funds.

#### High Guard election

When the new voting system is in place the High Guard will have to become active
to guard the network from malicious proposals. There will be a new selection
machanism for people to enter and leave the HG.

#### Effect Academy

This is a system for the onboarding of new users on the platform. It should make
it easy and fun for people to start earning on Effect Network, and at the same
time train you in the required skills to work on specific tasks.

#### In-App Swapping

Before introducing FIAT on and off ramps, it needs to be easier for users to 
connect their wallets and swap their funds to EFX and out. This process wil be done via an easy
to use widget where users can swap in and out of other assets on BSC.

#### Hackathon and grants program

In order to promote more development of dApps on the Effect Network we will start a grants program.
Where developers will be able to apply for a grant at the DAO, and funds will be distributed to the developer
to help them get started developing, integrating their dApp.
Furthermore the possibility to do another hackathon is being discussed.
