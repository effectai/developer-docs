# Campaign

The Effect Network campaign is the main orginisational unit within which certain types of tasks are done. 
Multiple campaigns can be owned by one user. Campaigns can contain only one [template](template.md). 
As discussed in the template section, templates are used to present tasks to the workers.
They are predefined by the requester and then presented to the user filled in with data and input elements for users to interact with the template.


## Campaign --- this piece needs to be rewritten.
The next step now is to create the campaign object. This campaign object contains essential information such as; what kind of campaign it is, which template is used, and how much workers are rewarded. When the campaign object is uploaded to an IPFS service, retrieve your hash. This hash is used to create the campaign. Storing data directly on the blockchain is possible, but it is costly; thus, for now, we will be using the method. That way the campaign data is not stored on the blockchain itself but can be easily referenced from the smart contract and your dApps.
