## Building the Future of Work

We are building the Future of Work. Everyone says it, but it's true in our case:
welcome to the first work platform that&rsquo;s completely decentralized and
enables people to work from anywhere. Effect Network was established in 2017 by
an amazing community and a team that&rsquo;s passionate about a decentralized
future. What makes Effect tick is the EffectDAO, started in 2021, a community
organization with the goal to grow Effect Network by supporting the development
of projects in a socially responsible, inclusive, and transparent manner. The
DAO is the mechanism that drives frictionless entry into Web3 space and the
Future of Work.
