# High-Level Goals

Welcome to the Effect Network roadmap! This page lays out the big goals that the
project aims to achieve in the coming year. It provides a good high-level
overview of what is currently going on and the content is kept up to date with
development.

Most items on the roadmap link to an external issue or information page. You are
encouraged to contribute and join the discussion on the projects that interest
you.
